# automatedFarmServer

This project uses a raspberry pi to control and monitor the actions of what is to be an automated hydroponic farm. Various sensors (pH, nitrogen, co2, light, temperature and humidity) and actuators (pumps, fan, and solenoid valves) will be added. An interface will will be possible through a react powered frontend!

### API
All data generated bu this project will be made opensource and free to use. For now, only temperature and humidity data are readily available (updated every 10 minute).
